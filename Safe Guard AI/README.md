# 🛡️ Safeguard AI - AI-Powered CCTV Harassment Detection System

Safeguard AI is an AI-based safety solution designed to protect women in workplace and public environments. By using gesture recognition with CCTV feeds, it automatically detects distress signals (like an open palm gesture) and triggers real-time alerts, video streaming, and emergency responses.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. 📹 **Camera Feed** is continuously monitored.
2. 🖐️ **Open palm gesture** is detected using MediaPipe.
3. 🔁 **30-second video stream** is triggered via IP cam.
4. 🚨 **Alert sent** to control room and police with location.
5. 🎦 **Video evidence** is captured and stored securely.
6. 📍 **Live location** is shared to nearest police station.

## 🧠 Gesture Detection Overview

Safeguard AI uses MediaPipe to recognize a specific **open palm gesture** to signify distress. Upon detection:

* Live stream is activated
* Control room is notified
* Police are alerted with live location
* Evidence is recorded

---

## 📈 Future Scope

* 🔐 Face authentication before gesture detection
* 🌍 Multilingual speech-based SOS
* 🤖 ML-enhanced threat-level estimation
* ☁️ Cloud sync and log visualization
